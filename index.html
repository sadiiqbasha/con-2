            <h2>HYPERTEXT AND HYPERMEDIA DATA MINING</h2>
            <p>
            Hypertext and hypermedia DM can be characterized as mining data that includes
text, hyperlinks, text markups, and various other forms of hypermedia information. As
such, it is closely related to both Web mining and multimedia mining, which are covered
separately in this section, but in reality are quite close in terms of content and
applications. While the WWW is substantially composed of hypertext and hypermedia
elements, there are other kinds of hypertext/hypermedia data sources, including online
catalogues, digital libraries, online information DBs, and hyperlink and inter-document
structures.<br>
           </p>
        </div>  
    <div class="hi1">
           
            <p>
            Some of the important DM techniques used for hypertext and hypermedia DM
include classification (supervised learning), clustering (unsupervised learning),
semistructured learning, and social network analysis. In the case of classification, or
supervised learning, the process starts off by reviewing training data in which items are
marked as being part of a certain class or group. This data are the basis from which the
algorithm is trained (Chakrabarti, 2000). Unsupervised learning, or clustering, differs
from classification in that while classification involves the use of training data, clustering
is concerned with the creation of hierarchies of documents based on similarity and
organizes the documents based on that hierarchy. Semi-supervised learning and social
network analysis are other methods that are important to hypermedia-based DM.
Semisupervised learning is the case where there are both labeled and unlabeled documents and there is a need to learn from both types of documents. Social network analysis
is also applicable because the Web is considered a social network that examines networks
formed through collaborative association (Larson, 1996; Mizruchi, Mariolis, Schwartz,
& Mintz, 1986). Other research conducted in the area of hypertext DM includes work on
distributed hypertext resource discovery (Chakrabarti, van den Berg, & Dom, 1999).<br>

            <h2>VISUAL DM</h2>
            <p>
           Visual DM is an emerging area of explorative and intelligent data analysis and
mining, based on the integration of concepts from computer graphics, visualization
metaphors and methods, information and scientific data visualization, visual perception,
cognitive psychology, diagrammatic reasoning, visual data formatting, and 3-D collaborative virtual environments. Research and developments in the methods and techniques for visual DM have helped to identify many of the research directions in the field,
including visual methods for data analysis, visual DM process models, visual reasoning
and uncertainty management, visual explanations, algorithmic animation methods,
perceptual and cognitive aspects, and interactivity in visual DM. Other key areas include
the study of domain knowledge in visual reasoning, virtual environments, visual analysis
of large DBs, collaborative exploration and model building, metrics for evaluation,
generic system architectures and prototypes, and methods for visualizing semantic
content (Han & Kamber, 2001).<br>

            <h2>MULTIMEDIA DM</h2>
            <p>
           Multimedia DM is the mining and analysis of various types of data, including
images, video, audio, and animation. The idea of mining data that contains different kinds
of information is the main objective of multimedia DM (Zaiane, Han, Li, & Hou, 1998). As
multimedia DM incorporates the areas of text mining as well as hypertext/hypermedia
mining, these fields are closely related. Much of the information describing these other
areas also applies to multimedia DM. This field is also rather new, but holds much promise
for the future. A developing area in multimedia DM is that of audio DM (mining music).
The idea is basically to use audio signals to indicate the patterns of data or to represent
the features of DM results. It is possible not only to summarize melodies based on the
approximate patterns that repeatedly occur in the segment, but also to summarize style
based on tone, tempo, or the major musical instruments played (Han & Kamber, 2001;
Zaiane, Han, Li, & Hou, 1998; Zaiane, Han, & Zhu, 2000).<br>
           </p>

    <div class="hi1">
            <h2>SPATIAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DM</h2>
            <p>
           Aside from statistical or numeric data, it is also important to consider information
that is of an entirely different kind-i.e., spatial and geographic data that could contain
information about astronomical data, natural resources, or even orbiting satellites and
spacecraft that transmit images of earth from out in space. Much of this data is imageoriented and can represent a great deal of information if properly analyzed and mined
(Miller & Han, 2001). Analyzing spatial and geographic data includes such tasks as
understanding and browsing spatial data, uncovering relationships between spatial data
items (and also between non-spatial and spatial items), and also analysis using spatial
DBs and spatial knowledge bases. The applications of these would be useful in such
fields as remote sensing, medical imaging, navigation, and related uses. Some of the
techniques and data structures that are used to analyze spatial and related types of data
include the use of spatial warehouses, spatial data cubes, and spatial On Line Analytic
Processing (OLAP). Spatial data warehouses can be defined as those that are subjectoriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time-variant (Han, Kamber, & Tung, 2001). Aside
from the implementation of data warehouses for spatial data, there is also the issue of
analyses that can be done on the data. Some of the analyses that can be done include
association analysis, clustering methods, and the mining of raster DBs. There have been a number of studies conducted on spatial DM (Bedard, Merritt, & Han 2001; Han, Kamber
& Tung, 1998; Han, Koperski, & Stefanovic, 1997; Han, Stefanovic, & Koperski, 1998;
Koperski, Adikary, & Han, 1996; Koperski & Han, 1995; Koperski, Han, & Marchisio,
1999; Koperski, Han, & Stefanovic, 1998; Tung, Hou, & Han, 2001).<br>

    <div class="hi1">
            <h2>TIME SERIES/SEQUENCE DM</h2>
            <p>
           Another important area in DM centers on the mining of time-series and sequencebased data. Simply put, this involves the mining of a sequence of data that can either be
referenced by time (time-series, such as stock market and production process data), or
is simply a sequence of data that are ordered in a sequence. In general, one aspect of
mining time-series data focuses on the goal of identifying movements or components that
exist within the data (trend analysis). These can include long-term or trend movements,
seasonal variations, cyclical variations, and random movements (Han & Kamber, 2001).
 Other techniques that can be used on these kinds of data include similarity search,
sequential-pattern mining, and periodicity analysis. Similarity search is concerned with
the identification of a pattern sequence that is close or similar to a given pattern.
Sequential- pattern mining has as its focus the identification of sequences that occur
frequently in a time series or sequence of data. Periodicity analysis attempts to analyze
the data from the perspective of identifying patterns that repeat or recur in a time series
(Han, Dong, & Yin, 1999; Han & Kamber, 2001; Han, Pei, & Yin, 2000; Kim, Lam, & Han,
2000; Pei, Han, Pinto, Chen, Dayal, & Hsu, 2001; Pei, Tung, & Han, 2001).<br>

            <h2>DM TRENDS: METHODS AND TECHNIQUES</h2>
             <h3>Constraint-Based DM</h3>
            <p>
           Many of the DM techniques that currently exist are very useful but lack the benefit
of any guidance or user control. One method of inserting some form of human involvement into DM is in the form of constraint-based DM. This form of DM incorporates the
use of constraints that guide the process. Frequently, this is combined with the benefits
of multidimensional mining to add greater power to the process (Han, Lakshamanan, &
Ng, 1999). There are several categories of constraints that can be used, each with its own
characteristics and purpose. These include knowledge-type constraints, that specify
the “type of knowledge” that is to be mined, and are typically specified at the beginning
of any DM query. Some of the types of constraints that can be used include clustering,
association, and classification. Data constraints identify the data that are to be used in
the specific DM query. Since constraint-based mining is ideally conducted within the
framework of an ad hoc, query-driven system, data constraints can be specified in a form
similar to that of a SQL query. Because much of the information being mined is in the form
of a DB or multidimensional data warehouse, it is possible to specify constraints that
identify the levels or dimensions (dimension/level constraints) to be included in the
current query. It would also be useful to determine what ranges of a particular variable
or measure are considered to be particularly interesting and should be included in the query (interestingness constraints). Finally, rule constraints specify the specific rules
that should be applied and used for a particular DM query or application.<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi1">
           
            <p>
            One application of the constraint-based approach is in the Online Analytical
Mining Architecture (OLAM) developed by Han, Lakshamanan, and Ng (1999), which
is designed to support the multidimensional and constraint-based mining of DBs and
data warehouses. In short, constraint-based DM is one of the developing areas that allow
the use of guiding constraints, which should make for better DM. A number of studies
have been conducted in this area (Cheung, Hwang, Fu, & Han, 2000; Lakshaman, Ng, Han,
& Pang, 1999;Lu, Feng, & Han, 2000; Pei & Han, 2000; Pei, Han, & Lakshaman, 2001; Pei,
Han, & Mao, 2000; Tung, Han, Lakshaman, & Ng, 2001; Wang, He, & Han, 2000; Wang,
Zhou, & Han, 2000).<br>

    <div class="hi1">
            
             <h3>Phenomenal DM</h3>
            <p>
           Phenomenal DM is not a term for a DM project that went extremely well. Rather, it
focuses on the relationships between data and the phenomena that are inferred from the
data (McCarthy, 2000). One example of this is that by using receipts from cash supermarket purchases, it is possible to identify various aspects of the customers who are making
these purchases. Some of these phenomena could include age, income, ethnicity, and
purchasing habits. One aspect of phenomenal DM, and in particular the goal to infer
phenomena from data, is the need to have access to some facts about the relations
between this data and their related phenomena. These could be included in the program
that examines data for phenomena or in a kind of knowledge base or DB that can be drawn
upon when doing the DM. Part of the challenge in creating such a knowledge base
involves the coding of common sense into a DB, which has proved to be a difficult
problem so far (Lyons & Tseytin, 1998).<br>

             <h2>DM FOR BIOINFORMATICS</h2>
            <p>
           Bioinformatics is the science of storing, extracting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and utilizing information from biological sequences and molecules. It has been fueled
mainly by advances in DNA sequencing and mapping techniques. The Human Genome
Project has resulted in an exponentially growing DB of genetic sequences. KDD
techniques are playing an increasingly important role in the analysis and discovery of
sequence, structure, and functional patterns or models from large sequence DBs. High
performance techniques are also becoming central to this task (Han et al., 2001; Han &
Kamber, 2001).<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi1">
            
            <p>
           Bioinformatics provides opportunities for developing novel mining methods. Some
of the main challenges in bioinformatics include protein structure prediction, homology
search, multiple alignment and phylogeny construction, genomic sequence analysis,
gene finding and gene mapping, as well as applications in gene expression data analysis,
and drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry. As a consequence of the large
amounts of data produced in the field of molecular biology, most of the current
bioinformatics projects deal with the structural and functional aspects of genes and
proteins. Many of these projects are related to the Human Genome Project. The data produced by thousands of research teams all over the world are collected and organized
in DBs specialized for particular subjects; examples include GDB, SWISS-PROT, GenBank,
and PDB. Computational tools are needed to analyze the collected data in the most
efficient manner. For example, bioinformaticists are working on the prediction of the
biological functions of genes and proteins based on structural data (Chalifa-Caspi.
Prilusky, & Lancet1998). Another example of a bioinformatics application is the GeneCards
encyclopedia (Rebhan, Chalifa-Caspi, Prilusky, & Lancet 1997). This resource contains
data about human genes, their products and the diseases in which they are involved.<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi1">
            
            <p>
           Since DM offers the ability to discover patterns and relationships from large
amounts of data, it seems ideally suited to use in the analysis of DNA. This is because
DNA is essentially a sequence or chain of four main components called nucleotides. A
group of several hundred nucleotides in a certain sequence is called a gene, and there
are about 100,000 genes that make up the human genome. Aside from the task of
integrating DBs of biological information noted above, another important application is
the use of comparison and similarity search on DNA sequences. This is useful in the
study of genetics-linked diseases, as it would be possible to compare and contrast the
gene sequences of normal and diseased tissues and attempt to determine what sequences
are found in the diseased, but not in the normal, tissues. There are a number of projects
that are being conducted in this area, whether on the areas discussed above, or on the
analysis of micro-array data and related topics. Among the centers doing research in this
area are the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in Cambridge, UK, and the Weizmann
Institute of Science in Israel.<br>

             <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>
           This chapter has discussed a number of technologies, approaches, and research
areas that have been identified as having critical and future promise in the field of DM.
For instance, with the Web becoming such as important part of the computing community, it is not surprising that Web mining is one of the most promising areas in DM. There
are several areas of Web-based mining, all of which can bring about exciting new
knowledge about information on the Web, Web- usage patterns, and the intricacies of
how the Web has been “woven.” Coupled with this is the explosion in the amount of
information that we now produce and have access to—much in the form of electronic and
hard-copy text documents. Mining information from these text sources can uncover
important information that had previously been buried in all of our reports, correspondence, memos, and other paperwork. The extensive use of handheld, wireless, and other
ubiquitous devices is another developing area, since a lot of information being created
and transmitted would be maintained and stored only on these kinds of devices. Among
the other areas that have been developed, investigated, and identified are hypertext and
hypermedia DM, which involves the processing and analysis of varying kinds of data;
phenomenal DM, which looks at identifying phenomenon associated with a set of data;
the mining of visual-oriented information; and the mining of other kinds of specialized
information.

            <p>
           ormation.
Another issue to look at is the social impact of mining for knowledge from data. This
includes whether DM can be considered a threat to data security and privacy. In fact,there are daily instances where data is being collected on individuals, in effect “profiling
users.” Consider the many transactions that one conducts on a daily basis; it would not
be difficult to understand the concerns that some have about the potential dangers of
misuse of information, e.g., surfing the Web, replying to an Internet newsgroup,
subscribing to a magazine, renting a video, joining a club, or making a purchase/
transaction with a credit card, supermarket loyalty card, or frequent flyer card-all of these
are opportunities for someone to collect personal information.<br>
